# Rabbit-Simulation [SP]

+ **Category**: School Project
+ **Status**: Discontinued

Mirror of the [original repo](https://github.com/xerstom/SP_Rabbit-Simulation).

## **Overview**

This project is a simulation project. The goal is to simulate the growth of a population of rabbit over time given several condition. The results must be stochastic but should allow to predict potential behaviour and infer reflexion and actions from behaviour studied.

## **Goal / Requirements**

The requirements can be found in the repo. There where several key elements to follow but we were free in our implementation or in any additional parameters we could add.  
The computation time can be very long due to the exponential number of instance we have to manage (population growth).

## **Technologies**

+ C++
